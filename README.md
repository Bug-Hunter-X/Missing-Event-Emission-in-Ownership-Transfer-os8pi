This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity smart contracts: the omission of event emissions in crucial state-changing functions. The bug occurs in the `_transferOwnership` function, where an `OwnershipTransferred` event is expected but not emitted. This can cause inconsistencies between the contract's internal state and what's observed by off-chain applications.  The solution shows how to correct the bug by emitting the necessary event.
